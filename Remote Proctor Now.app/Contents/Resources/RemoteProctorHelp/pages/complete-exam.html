  <h1>Completing the Exam</h1>
  <p>Completing the exam is simple and requires that you quit Remote Proctor, either through the <span class="uiref">Remote Proctor &gt; Quit</span> menu item or by pressing <span class="uiref">Command + Q</span>. You will be prompted with a confirmation dialog before being able to quit Remote Proctor. There may be a small delay while Remote Proctor exits to ensure the exam has been finalized.</p>
  <div class="box note">
	  <p>Each exam has an expected amount of time to be completed, an amount determined by the teacher. If this time were to run out, you will be presented with the following message (note that the time will likely be different):</p>
	  <p><img src="../images/exam-expectancy-reached.png"/></p>
	  <p>You may choose do either of the following:</p>
	  <div class="box task">
		<ol>
			<li>Selecting the <span class="uiref">Continue</span> option will reset the internal exam expectancy clock and allow you to continue your exam. This message may show up on more than one occasion and there is no limit to how many times you may continue.</li>
			<li>Selecting the <span class="uiref">Quit</span> options exits you out of Remote Proctor and finalizes the exam.</li>
			<li>Leaving this message active for more than 10 minutes will cause Remote Proctor to quit, even if you are still in an exam. You will need to contact your teacher for further instructions.</li>
