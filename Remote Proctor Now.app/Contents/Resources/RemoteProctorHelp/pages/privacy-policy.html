	<h3>Aggregated Personal Data:</h3>
	<p>In an ongoing effort to better understand and serve the users of the Software Secure Services, Software Secure often conducts research on its customer demographics, interests and behavior based on the Personal Data and other information provided to us. This research may be compiled and analyzed on an aggregate basis, and Software Secure may share this aggregate data with its affiliates, agents and business partners.

	<p>This Privacy Policy applies only to the Site. This Site may contain links to other web sites not operated or controlled by Software Secure (the “Third Party Sites”). The policies and procedures we described here do not apply to the Third Party Sites. The links from this Site do not imply that Software Secure endorses or has reviewed the Third Party Sites. We suggest contacting those sites directly for information on their privacy policies.</p>
	
	<h2>Security:</h2>
	<p>Software Secure takes reasonable steps to protect the Personal Data provided via the Site from loss, misuse, and unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration, or destruction. For example, all data transmission to the Site is through HTTPS (an encrypted channel between you and our servers) and all Personal Data is available only through secure login to the Site. However, no Internet or e-mail transmission is ever fully secure or error free. In particular, e-mail sent to or from this Site may not be secure. Therefore, you should take special care in deciding what information you send to us via e-mail. Please keep this in mind when disclosing any Personal Data to Software Secure via the Internet.</p>
