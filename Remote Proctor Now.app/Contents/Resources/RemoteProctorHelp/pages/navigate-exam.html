  <h1>Navigating to the Exam</h1>
  <p>Navigating to the exam you've selected is dependent on your LMS (Learning Management System) or CMS (Course Management System). If you are unsure of how to use your organization's system, contact your teacher.</p>
  <div class="box note">
	  <p>There is a time limit to navigate to the selected exam. A timer in the upper right corner of the window will show how much time you have available. If this timer runs out, you will be prompted with the following alert:</p>
	  <p><img src="../images/need-password-time.png"/></p>
	  <p>The user has several options:</p>
	  <div class="box task">
		<ol>
			<li>Selecting the <span class="uiref">Request More Time</span> option will reset the clock to enter the exam to the same amount of time as initially provided. Should this time expire again, Remote Proctor will reset and you will have to go through the authentication process again.</li>
			<li>Selecting the <span class="uiref">Ignore</span> option indicates that you're already in the exam even though we were unable to detect it. The timer is cleared and you may resume taking your exam.</li>
			<li>Selecting the <span class="uiref">Quit</span> options exits you out of Remote Proctor. This will not prevent you from trying to enter your exam again.</li>
			<li>Leaving this message active for too long will cause Remote Proctor to quit. This will not prevent you from trying to enter your exam again. The amount of time is determined by either the time to get to the exam or 5 minutes, whichever is lower.</li>
		</ol>
	  </div>
  </div>
  <p>Upon navigating to the password page of the selected exam, the <img src="../images/password-button.png"/> button in the window toolbar becomes available. Selecting it will populate the exam password field. Submitting this password will allow you to enter the exam.</p>

  <div class="box note">
	<p>If you accidentally navigate to an exam that you did not initially select, you may still navigate to the correct exam and insert the password for that exam.</p>
	<p>If the exam password does not allow entry to the exam and you've confirmed that the password page is for the initially selected exam, please contact your teacher for further instructions.</p>
